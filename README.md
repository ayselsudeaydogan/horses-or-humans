# 🐱🐶 Horses or Humans Classification Project  

## 🌟 Overview  
This project focuses on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras to classify images of humans and horses. It is part of an AI-based application development assignment, and the primary goal is to explore and implement deep learning techniques for image classification.

---

## ⚙️ Features  
- **Dataset**: 📂 Images of horses and humans (e.g., Tensorflow’s horses_or_humans dataset)  
- **Model**: 🧠 Custom CNN architecture or Transfer Learning (e.g., MobileNet, ResNet)  
- **Performance Evaluation**: 📊 Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  
- **Tools**: 🛠️ TensorFlow, Keras, Google Colab  

---

## 📁 Dataset  
The dataset used for this project is publicly available on Kaggle ([link to the dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/horses_or_humans)) or any other relevant source. It consists of labeled images of cats and dogs for training and testing.  

**Data Preprocessing**:  
- 🖼️ Resizing and normalizing images  
- 🔄 Data augmentation techniques (e.g., flipping, rotation)
